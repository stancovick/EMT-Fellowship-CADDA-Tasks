# EMT Fellowship CADDA Task 2 ‚Äì Toxicity Data Exploration

## üìñ Overview
This notebook explores the **Tox21 toxicity dataset** from [DrugDataResource](https://github.com/kexinhuang12345/DrugDataResource).  
It identifies toxicity patterns across assays and highlights compounds with low toxicity, as part of the **EMT Fellowship CADDA program (Group 7)**.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Steps Performed
1. Loaded and cleaned the dataset (removed missing values).  
2. Summarized toxicity outcomes (toxic vs non-toxic per assay).  
3. Visualized patterns using bar charts, heatmaps, and histograms.  
4. Selected compounds that passed all assays (potential safe leads).  

---

## üí° Key Findings
- Some assays show higher toxicity frequency (harder to pass).  
- Certain assays correlate, indicating related toxicity mechanisms.  
- A small subset of compounds passed all assays ‚Äî potential safe candidates.

## üß† Tools Used
Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook
